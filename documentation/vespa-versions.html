<p>
Vespa uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.
</p><p>
Java APIs, web service APIs and all application package constructs are supported through a major release
and only removed in a new release if they are already marked deprecated.
</p><p>
Use of deprecated Java APIs will cause a warning on compilation,
and use of deprecated application package constructs will cause a deprecation warning on deployment.
Note that Java APIs come in two categories:
<ul>
  <li><em>Public APIs</em> carry the compatibility guarantee and are visible from your code
    as well as in the <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/application">javadoc</a></li>
  <li><em>Exported APIs</em> are also visible from your code,
   but is not in the public javadoc and carry no compatibility guarantee</li>
</ul>
Check the javadoc list to verify that you are using public packages.
</p><p>
Some public Java classes and methods are annotated with <em>com.google.common.annotations.Beta</em>.
These are under development, and may still change before they stabilize.

<h2 id="stored-data">Stored Data</h2>
<p>
Data written to Vespa is compatible between adjacent releases.
For self-hosted systems, it may be necessary to upgrade through each
minor release rather than in larger leaps to ensure Vespa can read existing data.
This is a good practice in any case.
