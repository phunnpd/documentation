<p>
Vespa uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.
</p><p>
Java APIs, web service APIs and all application package constructs are supported through a major release
and only removed in a new release if they are already marked deprecated.
</p><p>
Use of deprecated Java APIs will cause a warning on compilation,
and use of deprecated application package constructs will cause a deprecation warning on deployment.
Note that Java APIs come in two categories:
<ul>
  <li><em>Public APIs</em> carry the compatibility guarantee and are visible from your code
    as well as in the <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/application">javadoc</a></li>
  <li><em>Exported APIs</em> are also visible from your code,
   but is not in the public javadoc and carry no compatibility guarantee</li>
</ul>
Check the javadoc list to verify that you are using public packages.
</p><p>
Some public Java classes and methods are annotated with <em>com.google.common.annotations.Beta</em>.
These are under development, and may still change before they stabilize.
</p>



<h2 id="stored-data">Stored Data</h2>
<p>
Data written to Vespa is compatible between adjacent releases.
For self-hosted systems, it may be necessary to upgrade through each
minor release rather than in larger leaps to ensure Vespa can read existing data.
This is a good practice in any case.
</p><p>
Also see the <a href="operations/live-upgrade.html">upgrade procedure</a>.
</p><p>
When changes to the format of the stored data in Vespa are made,
one cannot downgrade / roll back an upgrade without going through the below list
to understand steps required:
</p>
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<!--
 It is hard to be specific, this depends on the change made.
 It would be great if we can release versions that can read the new format but not write it yet.
 That way, one can upgrade to vespa-x.y.z1 (which can _read_ new format),
 then vespa-x.y.z2 or higher (which also _writes_ new format)
 One can then roll back to vespa-x.y.z1 as needed.
 Maybe this is overcomplicating - but this doc should nevertheless track such changes in specific versions,
 and precautions per release
